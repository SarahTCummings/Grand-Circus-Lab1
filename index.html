  <p>All day
        its dark, slick bronze soaks
        in a mossy place,
        its teeth,

        a multitude
        set
        for the comedy
        that never comes--

        its tail
        knobbed and shiny,
        and with a heavyweight's punch
        packed around the bone.

        In beautiful Florida
        he is king
        of his own part
        of the black river,

        and from his nap
        he will wake
        into the warm darkness
        to boom, and thrust forward,

        paralyzing
        the swift, thin-waisted fish,
        or the bird
        in its frilled, white gown,

        that has dipped down
        from the heaven of leaves
        one last time,
        to drink.

        Don't think
        I'm not afraid.
        There is such an unleashing
        of horror.

        Then I remember:
        death comes before
        the rolling away
        of the stone. "At Black River" by Mary Oliver </p>
